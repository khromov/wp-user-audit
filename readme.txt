Keep track of your users password strength and remind them to set a strong password

== Description ==

This plugin introduces functionality to keep track of the password strength of the users on your WordPress site. When a user
changes their password, the strength of their current password will show up in the user list. (Existing password strength set
before plugin activation is not viewable.)

Users who choose a weak password will be presented with an admin notice urging them to set a stronger password. (The threshold is configurable
via the `wpa_password_notice_password_strength_less_than_strength` filter.)

This plugin is multisite compatible and will show up in the network admin users list.
